Cloaked-Hipster
===============

Overview
---------
This is a Sample Repository for teaching software entrepreneurship and software engineering.   It has been used at both [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu) and [Ashesi University](http://www.ashesi.org).  It has been designed so that pieces of it can be cloned and used in your own project, specifically this readme and the [wiki](https://github.com/toddwseattle/Cloaked-Hipster/wiki).  Most of the information is in the wiki.  

Using the Cloaked-Hipster Project
---------------------------------
Most of the information about using the cloaked-hipster project is found in the wiki in the [help](https://github.com/toddwseattle/Cloaked-Hipster/wiki/Help-Pages) section.

The wiki can be seperately cloned from github into a directory called `myproj.wiki` by executing the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/toddwseattle/Cloaked-Hipster.wiki myproj.wiki
